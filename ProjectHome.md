This project connect:
ruby lexer (rlex) that was written by:
> http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-lex/
and ruby parser (rbison) that was written by:
> http://src.gnu-darwin.org/ports/devel/ruby-rbison/

This two projects use flex and bison from c\c++ to generate c\c++ code.

And from that moment you can use wellknown lexer\parser languages.

Not so simple template to programming, but simple to understanding inside.
Use lex & bison in your ruby projects to parse input, or to create different compilers.

_Contain flex and bison (win32 binaries) that you can use._

Easy to use, and work!
